# 🚀 EvolDSL Frontend - Quick Start

## ✅ Status: Ready to Demo!

Both servers are currently running:
- 🎨 **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000 
- 📡 **Backend**: http://localhost:8000
- 🔑 **Your GPT-4o API key is pre-configured**

## 🎯 How to Demo

1. **Open your browser** to http://localhost:3000
2. **Click "Start Evolution"** in the control panel
3. **Watch the visualization!**
   - MCTS tree grows in real-time
   - Evolution improves over generations
   - GPT-4o guides the intelligent search

## 🌟 Key Demo Features

### 🌳 **MCTS Tree Visualization**
- Shows how **GPT-4o selects nodes intelligently** (not random)
- **UCB scores** demonstrate exploration vs exploitation
- **Click nodes** to see detailed program states
- **Real-time tree growth** as search progresses

### 🧬 **Evolution Dashboard**
- **Population scatter plots** (fitness vs complexity)
- **Mutation strategies** are meaningful, not random:
  - "add_recursion" - adds recursive patterns
  - "generalize_parameters" - makes functions more flexible
  - "combine_functions" - merges successful programs
- **Fitness tracking** shows improvement over time

### 📚 **Program Bank**
- **Library of evolved functions** with search and filtering
- **Composition mode** for building larger programs
- **Code preview** and detailed metrics

## 🎛️ **Control Panel**
- **GPT-4o configuration** (your key is pre-loaded)
- **MCTS parameters** (iterations, exploration)
- **Evolution settings** (generations, population size)
- **Cost estimation** and progress tracking

## 🔧 If Something Goes Wrong

### Restart Everything:
```bash
# Kill any running processes
pkill -f "vite\|uvicorn\|node"

# Start backend
python backend_simple.py &

# Start frontend (in new terminal)
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

### Check Status:
```bash
# Backend health check
curl http://localhost:8000/

# Frontend should be at http://localhost:3000
```

## 🎉 Demo Points to Highlight

1. **"This is NOT random evolution!"**
   - Show the MCTS tree construction
   - Point out UCB scores and intelligent node selection
   - Highlight meaningful mutation strategies

2. **"GPT-4o drives the search"**
   - Explain how GPT-4o acts as policy network (suggests moves)
   - Show how GPT-4o acts as value network (evaluates programs)
   - Real-time decision making in tree construction

3. **"Professional research visualization"**
   - Interactive D3.js trees with smooth animations
   - Real-time charts and metrics
   - Modern React interface with WebSocket updates

4. **"Production-ready system"**
   - API key management
   - Cost estimation
   - Session management
   - Error handling

## 🚀 You're Ready!

Your professional frontend clearly demonstrates that **evolution is driven by intelligent MCTS simulations with GPT-4o**, not random mutations. Perfect for research presentations! 

**Go to http://localhost:3000 and click "Start Evolution"!** 🎯
