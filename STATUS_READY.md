- Point out intelligent node selection by GPT-4o
- Highlight meaningful mutation strategies:
  - "add_recursion" - adds recursive patterns
  - "generalize_parameters" - makes functions flexible
  - "combine_functions" - merges successful programs

### **"GPT-4o drives the search"**
- Policy network suggests next moves
- Value network evaluates program quality
- Real-time decision making in tree visualization

### **"Professional research tool"**
- Interactive D3.js trees with smooth animations
- Real-time evolution dashboard
- Modern React interface with professional styling

## 🎉 **You're All Set!**

**Go to http://localhost:3000 and start your professional EvolDSL demo!** 

Your frontend clearly demonstrates that evolution is driven by intelligent MCTS simulations with GPT-4o, not random mutations. Perfect for research presentations! 🚀
